### Apt setup
# You can choose to install non-free and contrib software.
d-i apt-setup/non-free boolean true
d-i apt-setup/contrib boolean true

# Squeeze only: (doesn't seem to effect maverick/natty/oneiric/precise..)
# (working around a gcc/bug, where netinstall locks up here, cross compiled *.deb would work fine...)
# Note: this workaround is disabled in serial mode
d-i console-tools/archs string skip-config
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US
d-i console-keymaps-at/keymap select us


#Removes the prompt about missing modules:
# Continue without installing a kernel?
d-i base-installer/kernel/skip-install boolean true
# Continue the install without loading kernel modules?
d-i anna/no_kernel_modules boolean true

# Controls whether to use NTP to set the clock during the install
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true
# NTP server to use. The default is almost always fine here.

### Partitioning
## Partitioning example
# If the system has free space you can choose to only partition that space.
# This is only honoured if partman-auto/method (below) is not set.
d-i partman-auto/init_automatically_partition select biggest_free

# Alternatively, you may specify a disk to partition. If the system has only
# one disk the installer will default to using that, but otherwise the device
# name must be given in traditional, non-devfs format (so e.g. /dev/hda or
# /dev/sda, and not e.g. /dev/discs/disc0/disc).
# For example, to use the first SCSI/SATA hard disk:
d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/mmcblk0

# Or provide a recipe of your own...
# If you have a way to get a recipe file into the d-i environment, you can
# just point at it.
d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe_file string /partition_recipe

# Individual additional packages to install
d-i pkgsel/include string uboot-mkimage pastebinit initramfs-tools wget firmware-linux ntpdate bash fbset

# Whether to upgrade packages after debootstrap.
# Allowed values: none, safe-upgrade, full-upgrade
d-i pkgsel/upgrade select safe-upgrade

# Controls whether to use NTP to set the clock during the install
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true

# During installations from serial console, the regular virtual consoles
# (VT1-VT6) are normally disabled in /etc/inittab. Uncomment the next
# line to prevent this.
d-i finish-install/keep-consoles boolean true

# Avoid that last message about the install being complete.
d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note

# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
# packages and run commands in the target system.
