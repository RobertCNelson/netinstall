Easy:
* debug.log, to help troubleshoot failures (do we need anything else /boot/uboot/backup/* after install)
* random http link to *.deb package (--deb-file just needs to be extended to http case, as it works for local files)
* move most of scripts/*tweaks.diff to scripts/*finish.sh as the *.diff is stuck with busybox limiations..

More Effort:
* ext2 boot instead of vfat
**ti: omap3/4 will always need vfat for MLO bootloader
**freescale: mx51/53/6 has bootloader dd'd to boot device, could use ext2 over vfat..
***imx6 is ext2 by default, mx51/53 need more testing..
